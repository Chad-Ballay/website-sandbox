      <description>The third part of the triangle is proof of work. Taking up the task of doing CTF&amp;rsquo;s, hack the boxes, etc&amp;hellip; So far it&amp;rsquo;s been a grab bag. Some aspects I intuit due sysadmin background. Other ones not so much. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a long ways to go on understanding some of the windows side of the coin and definitely with OWASP content.
First one just happened to be PicoCTF which feels a bit like I&amp;rsquo;m being triffiling.</description>

      <description>Starting the second part of my pivot triangle. Degree, certs, and proof of work. The certs part is going to be some of the roughest parts of the path. College is cheap and success is pretty broadly defined. (Make straight C&amp;rsquo;s and still have a degree&amp;hellip;)
For the certs I&amp;rsquo;ve got to layout a path and figure out on my own which ones fit the future I want. All on my own dime for right now.</description>

      <description>My employer, Walmart, has started offering a tuition benefit to all employees. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly geared for associates trying to get their first degree but it is open to everyone. It works out to a dollar a day, they cover all other tuition and books. That was too enticing to pass up and so I&amp;rsquo;m starting on my second bachelors. Cybersecurity at Bellevue University.
It feels weird saying that on multiple levels.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this as I sit in the Endobariatric Hospital in Piedras Negras, Mexico awaiting surgery tomororw. I&amp;rsquo;m on the cusp of turning 40 and my midlife crisis is yielding a vertical sleeve gastonomy to help me overcome my weight. Harnessing this nervousness led me down the path of putting together a goal list. Which in turn has led me down a hair splitting argument about instead referring to it as an Impossible Listâ„¢.</description>

      <description>Travel  Go to Iceland and see the aurora or even the geography depending on the time of year. National Parks are America&amp;rsquo;s best idea and I want to see them all.  Bryce Canyon Zion National Park Hot Springs Yellowstone Everglades Gateway Arch Grand Teton Great Smokey Mountains Grand Canyon Denali Arches Glacier Yosemite Big Bend   Visit Oktoberfest in Munich. Lafayette&amp;rsquo;s Tomb on July 4th. Colonial Williamsburg Headwaters of the Mississippi River  Exercise  Running - A long time a go I set out to complete a marathon.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t take it anymore. I just can&amp;rsquo;t take it. The unending slew of ads are taking their toll. Wasting of bandwidth and certainly frustrating when they cause the @#$&amp;amp; content to not render correctly. Tonight&amp;rsquo;s project is building and using a Pi-Hole for my network.
  Get Raspbian (There a couple of OS&amp;rsquo;s that would work but I&amp;rsquo;m going for simple.)
  Get Etcher (Again, you can use a couple of different tools to flash a microSD card.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big old boy. No doubting it. Six foot six inches and a weight that fluctuates from 360lbs to 410lbs. I&amp;rsquo;ll never be a small man but I&amp;rsquo;m looking at 40 and realizing that I miss out on shit. Airplane travel, riding carnival rides with the kids, swimming with the kids, etc, etc&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been on my radar for over a decade. When I would dip my toe into the research I would usually hit the wall of the cost.</description>

This seems to have worked. Now time to setup drone.io and netlify correctly.</description>

      <title>Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans?</title>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s Empire, Louisiana and that&amp;rsquo;s my home town. A small town that is an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive outside of New Orleans. It&amp;rsquo;s where I actually grew up but let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, which are people going to know?
Most people&amp;rsquo;s visual memory of New Orleans in the media probably stems from the glitz and glam of drunken, costumed reveliers celebrating Mardi Gras. Or, those wretched souls walking through waist deep flood waters after Katrina.</description>

      <description>The route
My physical stretch goal this year is to ride my bike across Iowa. I&amp;rsquo;m stoked to do this after watching all the various recap videos but my biggest fear isn&amp;rsquo;t the ride itself. It&amp;rsquo;s the 8,500 strangers and the sleeping outside in a tent. Not gonna lie, those two things are striking fear in me. (Brief history is that a bunch of people did this ride decades ago on a whim.</description>

      <description>Observabilty Practioners Summit Attended this as a pre-KubeCon 2018 event. My current task at work revolves around the Online Grocery product at Walmart. https://grocery.walmart.com/ It&amp;rsquo;s a organicly grown product that evolved from previous efforts internally. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a hodge podge of technologies running a code base that stretches back from years ago. Definitely not a green field since some of the tech stack doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an out of the box monitoring solutions.</description>

      <description>Infrastructure As Code Should Also Apply To Your IDE A craftsman and his tools are often romanticized as having a bond. The tools becomes an extension of the will and personality of the craftsman. By examining the tools you can tell the quality of the creation potential. Or how eccentric and therefore better the creator was. George R. R. Martin and WordStar. David Allen and Lotus Notes. Etc, etc&amp;hellip; Or at least that&amp;rsquo;s the lie I&amp;rsquo;ve told myself.</description>

      <description>EDLPi - Every Day Low Prices Pi&amp;hellip;
Every Day Low Prices(EDLP) - A unrelenting effort to be as efficient as possible to ensure that prices are as low as possible.
The goal here is to build a Raspberry Pi cluster that can be scaled up with ease using Ansible, Kubernetes, and Docker. This is to demonstrate how cheap, commodity hardware can be tied together into one monolithic API. In other words, going from several atomic systems with multiple failure points into one giant, fault tolerant system.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got 26 servers(4 db, 20 app &amp;amp; 2 dev) to coordinate and it looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be using Ansible. I am stoked. Most of my sysadmin career was around writing clever little scripts to make my job easier. Now time to write clever little playbooks to make orchestrating tinge whole kit and kaboodle easier. The only downside is that my servers are gonna be in Azure so I&amp;rsquo;ve got to learn Powershell and more .</description>

      <description>Due to a series of (un)fortunate events this evening I had one of the best nights in a while. One of those nights that recharge you. Powers your spirits enough to lift those around you as well. In the past couple of weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out this whole bike commuting thing. Cars run on cash and make you fat, bikes run on fat and save you cash. Quick little 7 mile ride each way with one hell of a hill.</description>

      <description>GTD, Kanban, Agile, Pomodoro, etc, etc&amp;hellip; They all require one thing to be successfull. Me getting organized and executing the work. So time to try yet again at collecting my thoughts and efforts in a location so as to get stuff done. Well that and to showcase my bottom line value to future business interest willing to make me a stakeholder in their ventures.</description>
