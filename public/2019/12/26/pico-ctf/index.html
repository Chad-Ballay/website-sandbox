      <p>The third part of the triangle is proof of work.  Taking up the task of doing CTF&rsquo;s, hack the boxes, etc&hellip;  So far it&rsquo;s been a grab bag.  Some aspects I intuit due sysadmin background.  Other ones not so much.  I&rsquo;ve got a long ways to go on understanding some of the windows side of the coin and definitely with OWASP content.</p>
<p>First one just happened to be PicoCTF which feels a bit like I&rsquo;m being triffiling.  It really is one that is designed for high schoolers as the target audience.  Good news is that it is consistent from year to year and popular enough that I hope to use that as a baseline for comparison next year.</p>
<p>But&hellip;.  It&rsquo;s frustrating with these being time constrained most of the time.  I&rsquo;ve got a regular job, going back to school, studying for my certs, plus a wife and three kids.  Having that itch of wanting to dive more into it and knowing that I can&rsquo;t let the other parts of my life see any degradation of care is gonna be hard.  That rush of figuring out a hook into the next step of the puzzle is addictive.</p>
<p>It goes back to an analogy I used to explain why I enjoy the Ops side of my job so much.  The end goal is clearly stated.  Get root on this box, pull this data off of this machine, get the ctf flag code, etc, etc&hellip;  No ambiguity of what the end state is and you are free to get it done by any means you can think of.  No one complains about how you used &ldquo;Solution 1a.5&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Soulution 1a.6&rdquo; to the problem.  In the post mortem you review your steps and learn how to reduce your MTTR but in the moment you have the ability to horizonitally attack the problem from any vector you can.</p>
<p>So here is the beginning of my writeups.  It&rsquo;ll be infrequently updated for now since I have to budget time and focus with the calendar to deep dive on these.  Lots of stars that all have to be in alignment for me to be able to spend enough time to focus on some task.
