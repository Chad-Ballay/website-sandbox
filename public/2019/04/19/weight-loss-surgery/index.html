    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;m a big old boy.  No doubting it.  Six foot six inches and a weight that fluctuates from 360lbs to
410lbs.  I&rsquo;ll never be a small man but I&rsquo;m looking at 40 and realizing that I miss out on shit.  Airplane
travel, riding carnival rides with the kids, swimming with the kids, etc, etc&hellip;  It&rsquo;s been on my radar
for over a decade.  When I would dip my toe into the research I would usually hit the wall of the cost.
I want to be thinner but 26K+ is a bit much.  My work insurance won&rsquo;t cover it unless my foot damn near to
falling of due to diabetes.  So I waffled back and forth between yet another dieting strategy or just
dealing with being a hefty fat ass.</p>
<h2 id="see-the-world-get-cheap-surgery">See The World, Get Cheap Surgery.</h2>
<p>Enter in the spectre of Medical Tourism&hellip;.  <em>Queue jingoist American politician pearl clutching</em>  Seriously,
after years of hearing about how our medical industry is star-spangled awesomeness and every other country&rsquo;s
medical industry is barely on par with medieval leech vendors.  Its freakin 8k dollars and that&rsquo;s the top tier
one.  Generally the cost is around 5k.  I&rsquo;m going to spend 1/4 for this.  Why the hell didn&rsquo;t I look into this
sooner?  <a href="https://www.endobariatric.com/">Endobariatric</a></p>
<h2 id="whos-the-fairest-of-them-all">Who&rsquo;s The Fairest Of Them All?</h2>
<p>But roll my steps back one or two. How did I figure out which one to go with?  Honestly, I went with the tried
and true method of crowdsourced reviews.  Put on the regular bot filters and look at multiple review sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.obesityhelp.com/profiles/bariatric-center/laparoscopic-bariatric-center/">Obesity Help</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bariatricpal.com/topic/376960-dr-alvarez-reviews/">Bariatric Pal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bariatricreports.org/endobariatric/">Bariatric Reports</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/">Reddit.com/r/wls</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of clinics listed so I started cross checking clinic names and seeing which ones had multiple reviews across multiple sites.</p>
<h2 id="so-now-what">So Now What?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve paid my deposit and picked my date.  So now I wait.  Lots of waiting and trying to not talk myself out of
this.  Or use it as an excuse to go all out.  I&rsquo;m going with a vertical sleeve which means that besides a reduction
in the volume of what I eat, I&rsquo;ll also have a limit on the type of food I can eat.  It&rsquo;s a recipe for telling myself
that I better eat everything I can since it may be my last time to eat something&hellip;. (It&rsquo;s bullshit and I know it&rsquo;s
bullshit but it isn&rsquo;t suprising I am easily swayed when it comes to food.)</p>
