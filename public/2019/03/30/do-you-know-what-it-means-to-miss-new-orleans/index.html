    <div class="article-content">
      <p><img src="/images/Empire_Lousiana.png" alt="Map of where Empire, Lousiana is located"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire,_Louisiana">Empire, Louisiana</a> and
that&rsquo;s my home town.  A small town that is an hour&rsquo;s drive outside of
New Orleans.  It&rsquo;s where I actually grew up but let&rsquo;s be honest, which are
people going to know?</p>
<p>Most people&rsquo;s visual memory of New Orleans in the media probably stems from
the glitz and glam of drunken, costumed reveliers celebrating Mardi Gras.  Or,
those wretched souls walking through waist deep flood waters after Katrina.  It&rsquo;s
always a coin toss of what&rsquo;ll be someone&rsquo;s comment when I tell people where I&rsquo;m
from.  Was I there during the flood?  Does Mardi Gras really get that wild?  It&rsquo;s
alright too.  Both sides of that coin are true and equally important.</p>
<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been feeling a restless in myself to change my life.  I&rsquo;ve idealized
my beginnings to some fantastical modern day combination of Huck Finn and Encylcopedia
Brown.  My grandfather&rsquo;s barge the Miss Lucifer and his feats of junkyard engineering
right along with getting my first computer in the late 80&rsquo;s.  My parish had a school
boat for kids in the bayou camps to get to school.  Everything that I took for
granted that I wonder if in my impending midlife crisis that I&rsquo;m not over exagertating
to myself.</p>
<p>Putting all that aside I do find myself using that as a lens for my feelings of
disconnect.  Bad news about global warming, well that reminds me of the dead zone
that shows up in the Gulf of Mexico every sprind due to farm runoff.  Income inequality,
that just goes straight back to how the bankers of New Orleans flooded my parish
in 1927.  Corrupt politicians?  Well one of my first times voting for govener my
choice was between Edwin Edwards and David Duke.  The known crook and the KKK grand wizard.</p>
<p>So why is it that I feel a since of longing for a place that I ran away from the moment I
graduated high school and that every bad bit of news reminds me about the things that are
wrong with back home?  I just don&rsquo;t understand myself sometimes.</p>
