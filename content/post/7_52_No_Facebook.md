Oh for fuck's sake.  I weaned myself off of Facebook for a week because I was tired of feeling like shit for seeing all the great things people were doing.  The whole "Don't judge your behind the scenes reel against everyone else's best of reel." quote.  Forced myself to reach out to people to see how they were doing.  Yadda, yadda, yadda...

Now that I finally get around to documenting it Facebook has imploded with Cambridge Analytica shit.  Which is enough to get me to delete Facebook so I feel like a damn hipster about hating on it.
