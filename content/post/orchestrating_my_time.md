I've got 26 servers(4 db, 20 app &amp; 2 dev) to coordinate and it looks like I'll be using Ansible. I am stoked. Most of my sysadmin career was around writing clever little scripts to make my job easier. Now time to write clever little playbooks to make orchestrating tinge whole kit and kaboodle easier. The only downside is that my servers are gonna be in Azure so I've got to learn Powershell and more .Net.
