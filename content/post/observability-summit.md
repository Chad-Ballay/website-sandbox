# Observabilty Practioners Summit
Attended this as a pre-KubeCon 2018 event. My current task at work revolves around the Online Grocery product at Walmart.  [https://grocery.walmart.com/](https://grocery.walmart.com/)  It's a organicly grown product that evolved from previous efforts internally.  We've got a hodge podge of technologies running a code base that stretches back from years ago.  Definitely not a green field since some of the tech stack doesn't have an out of the box monitoring solutions.  I'm trying to find info from within about how much data I can share about documenting my efforts and results.

For now here are my notes.
