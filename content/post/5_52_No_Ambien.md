I don't sleep well.  It just isn't something that occurs easily for me.  I've had sleep studies that tell me to use a breathing machine, I've tried meditating before bed, and the best was when I was fresh out of a divorce and was working out every night till I was exhausted.  It isn't that I don't get tired.  Oh no, I'm dragging ass with the best of them after a sleepless night.  I just can't cut off my brain long enough to go and stay asleep.

So for this week I wanted to challenge myself.  I would have my Ambien next to the bed where if things got too unbearable I could take it.  But I had to wait until at least after midnight before I could give up going to sleep normally.  Easy escape valve if needed.  A good chunk of this is driven by my frustration at having to even need Ambien.  Sleep is a basic human function and I can't do it right.  Am I defective?  Or worse yet am I kidding myself and I could be ok at sleeping but I just like taking Ambien too much.

This past week was miserable but I did it.  Work output suffered and I spent more time in a haze of grogginess than I liked but I did it.  I am more than my medicine.  Does Ambien help?  Yes.  If I decided that I should go with out could I?  Yes.  That one is a touchy one.  My family has a predilection for chemical dependency so being able to know that I'm not dependent is reassuring.
