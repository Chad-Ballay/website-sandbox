# Infrastructure As Code Should Also Apply To Your IDE
A craftsman and his tools are often romanticized as having a bond.  The tools becomes an extension of the will and personality of the craftsman.  By examining the tools you can tell the quality of the creation potential.  Or how eccentric and therefore better the creator was. George R. R. Martin and WordStar.  David Allen and Lotus Notes.  Etc, etc...  Or at least that's the lie I've told myself.  In truth, it is just fun to fetishize the tools.  Marvel at the power, the novel UI hardware, the engineering specs.  

I'm very bad about this and combining it with my current workload its pretty foolish.  I spend more time than I should building a test environment in Vagrant/Docker than using the real infrastructure since I've got total control on my own machine.  I can move faster this way.  Supposedly.  Well its certainly hasn't failed me, just hasn't really delivered what I needed.  

In that spirit I'm taking on a new effort of migrating away from my laptop and into the cloud.  Setting up my own VPS for development.  Using the cloud to build live versions of what I'm testing instead of building fake versions here on my laptop.  All the normal greenfield promises you would expect.  

I'll link back to here as I tackle the specific items.

* VPS
* Cloud Environment
* Infrastructure As Code
* Source Code Repository
* Configuration Management
* Secrets
