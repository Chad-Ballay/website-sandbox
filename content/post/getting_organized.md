GTD, Kanban, Agile, Pomodoro, etc, etc...  They all require one thing to be successfull.  Me getting organized and executing the work.  So time to try yet again at collecting my thoughts and efforts in a location so as to get stuff done.  Well that and to showcase my bottom line value to future business interest willing to make me a stakeholder in their ventures.
