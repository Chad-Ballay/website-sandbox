In my defense, I missed this past Sunday due to family obligations.  The family was suffering a case of everyone pissed at everyone else so what better thing to do then to go on a surprise road trip to OKC Science Center.  It was a blast and I recommend going there if ever in the neighborhood.  In any case, last week's resolution is done and off to the next one.
