I'm a big old boy.  No doubting it.  Six foot six inches and a weight that fluctuates from 360lbs to 
410lbs.  I'll never be a small man but I'm looking at 40 and realizing that I miss out on shit.  Airplane
travel, riding carnival rides with the kids, swimming with the kids, etc, etc...  It's been on my radar
for over a decade.  When I would dip my toe into the research I would usually hit the wall of the cost.
I want to be thinner but 26K+ is a bit much.  My work insurance won't cover it unless my foot damn near to
falling of due to diabetes.  So I waffled back and forth between yet another dieting strategy or just 
dealing with being a hefty fat ass.

## See The World, Get Cheap Surgery.
Enter in the spectre of Medical Tourism....  *Queue jingoist American politician pearl clutching*  Seriously, 
after years of hearing about how our medical industry is star-spangled awesomeness and every other country's
medical industry is barely on par with medieval leech vendors.  Its freakin 8k dollars and that's the top tier
one.  Generally the cost is around 5k.  I'm going to spend 1/4 for this.  Why the hell didn't I look into this
sooner?  [Endobariatric](https://www.endobariatric.com/)

## Who's The Fairest Of Them All?
But roll my steps back one or two. How did I figure out which one to go with?  Honestly, I went with the tried 
and true method of crowdsourced reviews.  Put on the regular bot filters and look at multiple review sites.  
* [Obesity Help](https://www.obesityhelp.com/profiles/bariatric-center/laparoscopic-bariatric-center/)
* [Bariatric Pal](https://www.bariatricpal.com/topic/376960-dr-alvarez-reviews/)
* [Bariatric Reports](https://bariatricreports.org/endobariatric/)
* [Reddit.com/r/wls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/)

Lots of clinics listed so I started cross checking clinic names and seeing which ones had multiple reviews across multiple sites.

## So Now What?
I've paid my deposit and picked my date.  So now I wait.  Lots of waiting and trying to not talk myself out of
this.  Or use it as an excuse to go all out.  I'm going with a vertical sleeve which means that besides a reduction
in the volume of what I eat, I'll also have a limit on the type of food I can eat.  It's a recipe for telling myself
that I better eat everything I can since it may be my last time to eat something.... (It's bullshit and I know it's 
bullshit but it isn't suprising I am easily swayed when it comes to food.)
