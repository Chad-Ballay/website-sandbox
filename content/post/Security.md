![Roadmap](/images/Security_Cert_Map.png)

Starting the second part of my pivot triangle.  Degree, certs, and proof of work.  The certs part is going to be some of the roughest parts of the path.  College is cheap and success is pretty broadly defined.  (Make straight C's and still have a degree...)  

For the certs I've got to layout a path and figure out on my own which ones fit the future I want.  All on my own dime for right now.  For some of them I can make a request for them being covered by work but they've got to be relevant to my current role.  So Azure Administrator would be easy to ask for.  GSEC not so much.  

So the current target is Security+.  It's a good base level one.  It also included in DoD-Directive 8140/8570 list of common certs for compliancy.  Plus it is dirt cheap, especially with a student discount.  I probably waste more money on soft drinks in a year than it costs.
