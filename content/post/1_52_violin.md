First one up was to practice violin each and every day.  I just can't get motivated to join in this family activity.  I feel embarrassed and frustrated at how little progress I make for the amount of effort I put into it.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that this affects Elizabeth since this is a huge part of her life.  It was rough but I did it finally.
