So... Much... Spam...

This one required more mental endurance then I care to admit.  In the world of unlimited email storage and automated spam filters, I just didn't really give a shit about my incoming email.  10K unread emails just wasn't a thing to worry about.  Yeah it bothered me but it didn't bother me enough.  This past week every, and I mean every, spam email I got I unsubscribed.  Using the can?  Well forget about surfing the web you've got spam to unsubscribe to.  Waiting for the kids to finish their stuff?  Guess what link in the footer actually leads you to the unsubscribe button.  Quiet moment to browse Reddit for funny gifs?  Nope, time to unsubscribe some more.

I'm not at inbox zero but I'll turn this damn tide before the year is out.
