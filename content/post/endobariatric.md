I'm writing this as I sit in the [Endobariatric Hospital](https://www.endobariatric.com/) in Piedras Negras, Mexico awaiting surgery tomororw.  I'm on the cusp of turning 40 and my midlife crisis is yielding a vertical sleeve gastonomy to help me overcome my weight.  Harnessing this nervousness led me down the path of putting together a goal list.  Which in turn has led me down a hair splitting argument about instead referring to it as an [Impossible Listâ„¢](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/).  It's minor but I like the distinction.  I really don't know how well the inertia will continue but anything is movement in a positive direction.  

So without further ado here is my [Impossible List](https://chadballay.com/impossible-list/)
