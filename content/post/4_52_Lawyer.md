My child custody situation isn't that complex.  My ex-wife and I have joint custody with cost and time split equally.  One week with her, one week with me.  Pretty easy status quo to maintain as long as neither of us get laid off.  Which in the past year this has become a bigger specter than it used to.

Meet with my lawyer and walked through the situation.  Laid out my concerns, what I did and didn't like about the status quo, and what a "win" would look like if I ever had to leave the area...  I've got to hand it to my lawyer he didn't try and sugarcoat things or give me false hope.  The net of the conversation is that unless Colin's welfare is dramatically threatened that the current custody agreement will stand.  Colin will also stay in the area if either me or my ex leave the area.  So whoever is more dogged to stay in the area will "win".

Which sucks but it wasn't suprising.  The good thing is that I no longer don't know.  Militant ignorance won't fix this situation.  I either need to come to grips with the fact that my leaving the area will remove me from weekly contact with my son, or I need to make sure I can work remotely by beefing up my resume.  

The hardest part of the conversation was with my wife.  She really wants to move to a more progressive state.  I can understand why but its hard to not see this as a Sophie's choice.  I have to choose her happiness or my weekly presence in my son's life.  It is an unsettled conversation but at least we are a bit more instep on this.
