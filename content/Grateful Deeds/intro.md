The long, cold month of December has come again as it always does.  The kids are passingly aware of Jesus but painfully aware of Santa Claus.  I've got no one to blame but myself for that since I'm not even putting up a Christmas tree this year.  The schedule has them going to Mom's and I'm heading out of town very soon after dropping them off.  

Which leads to this effort...  Even with all the negative stuff I keep complaining about, things are not bad.  I know this but I don't really **KNOW** this deep in my bones.  So to help I'm going to try and list things that are good and that I'm grateful for.  Things that warm this little grinch like heart of mine.  ;-)

I would like to say I'll do this every day until the glacier melts into a roaring torrent or some shit.  But that's just unrealistic.  So I'll add to this when I can and when the doldrums of seasonal depression allow for it.
