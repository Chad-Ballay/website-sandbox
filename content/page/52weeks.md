## The itch

I have two favorite holidays each year.  Fourth of July takes number one due to an overgrown sense of patriotism, love of fireworks and an appreciation of a holiday is celebrated outside during warm weather.  My second favorite holiday is New Year's Day.  Everyone seems to be planning on bettering themselves.  Be it going to the gym, losing that 10 lbs, quitting smoking, being better about keeping in touch with family, etc, etc...  During that month you tell someone about some sappy self improvement plan and most of the time they will encourage you.  Can't eat out because you want to have a $1,000 emergency fund?  Ok we'll all stay in tonight and live cheaply to show our support.

## The genesis

While browsing Reddit I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iooz1TrCmbs).  The premise is that each week you setup some sort of stretch goal that could be accomplished wholly within that week.  Meaning to get your passport?  Get the paperwork filed that week.  Scared of donating blood?  Find and donate at a blood bank that week.  Now I did have to modify the premise.  I've got a wife that is 9 months postpartum, which means I also have a 9 month old baby, and a son who hates kindergarten, and another son who is having to fine tune his ADHD medicine.  Plus an ex-wife that can sometimes impact my day to day life as well as a job that keeps making the news about layoffs in our organization.  Needless to say, I'm not going to let this impact my home life.
