EDLPi - Every Day Low ~~Prices~~ Pi...

Every Day Low Prices(EDLP) - A unrelenting effort to be as efficient as possible to ensure that prices are as low as possible. 

The goal here is to build a Raspberry Pi cluster that can be scaled up with ease using Ansible, Kubernetes, and Docker.  This is to demonstrate how cheap, commodity hardware can be tied together into one monolithic API.  In other words, going from several atomic systems with multiple failure points into one giant, fault tolerant system.

Naah...  I'm too cheap to buy a whole bunch of hardware and I don't want to play with these technologies just as virtual servers.  It's a gussied up lab project.  ;-)
